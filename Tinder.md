<!-- Tinder -->
<h2 align="left">Tinder</h2>

Online dating app.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to easily arrange a date and set up a meeting.

**Description**: An app that allows people to make profiles focused on dating. If two profiles like each other, they get a match, allowing them to talk to each other and arrange a real life date if they want to. Tinder was first called MatchBox, and its features barely changed over time, because it was a very focused and simple idea, that early on, proved to work with its success among university students. At first, you would give a like or dislike on another profile. However, only one year later after the first MVP, the developers changed the like and dislike buttons to a swipe feature, where you swipe right to like and left to dislike, giving it a unique feel that was not common at the time. Not only the swap feature made the process of showing interest to a person faster, but it also gave an identity to the app, making it more iconic.
