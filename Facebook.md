<h2 align="left">Facebook</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: Students would like to share their university experiences though a social website that connects people.

**Description**: A social media website that allows students, from Harvard, to connect with people they've met at the university, sharing their experiences around the campus and creating discussions related to the institution. At first, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, created a website, in 2003, called Face Share, where people could vote which students were the most beautiful, and was mostly used as a joke. Harvard took the website down. However, it still worked as an inspiration for Zuckerberg to keep students engaged with each other through the internet, which lead to the creation of The Facebook, Mark's first real MVP.

Later on, Facebook decided to focus on being a social media for any person, and not just Harvard students, increasing the amount of features over time and adapting them to a wider public.
