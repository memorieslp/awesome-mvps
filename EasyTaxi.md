# Easy Taxi

### Company: Easy Taxi
Mobile App for taxi hailing.
### Type of MVP: Concierge
MVP created in 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that people would ask for a cab, however the backend was done manually.

What was done manually:
- After a costumer asks for a taxi through the website, the founders of Easy Taxi would receive an email showing the costumer's address. 
- The founders would call the taxi companies themselves.

Advantages of this method:
- No need to program a robust system that takes the address of people and sends it to taxi companies.
- No real bond was necessary to make between the website and the taxi companies.

This method was enough to see if people were interested in a service like this.
