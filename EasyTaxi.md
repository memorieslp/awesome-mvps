Mobile App for taxi hailing.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that people would ask for a cab, with the backend done manually. A costumer would order a taxi through the Easy Taxi website, giving their address and name. This process would generate an email to the founders, containing the information given by the costumers, which they would use to call a cab company. This method did not require the creation of a robust system that tracks the location of the user, or that automatically finds a taxi driver based on the address of the costumer, making it easier and cheaper to validate the hypothesis.
