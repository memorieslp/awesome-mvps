Most known for being an online retailer of many types of products, although Amazon also offers services such as cloud computing and digital streaming.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1995.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in buying multiple products online, without the need to visit stores.

Jeff Bezos, the founder, started testing this hyphothesis by scaling it down to books only.

**Description**: An online retailer store that sells books, however part of the backend was done manually. Jeff Bezos believed that online retailer stores was the future of the industry and the internet, so he started selling books online, because there were many books, and they were easy to buy and ship, they did not require big investiments and they were an extremely popular product. The first Amazon website is considered to be a Single Feature MVP, since all it did was selling books online, although Jeff Bezos would also physically buy the books and mail them to the costumers.

Bezos would add more types of products over the time, slowly validating his main hypothesis.
