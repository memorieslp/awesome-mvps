An e-commerce marketplace where you can hire and visit local services.

#### Type: Piecemeal
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to find places to visit and services to hire with ease.

**Description**: A web page that people would ask for a cab, with the backend done manually. A costumer would order a taxi through the Easy Taxi website, giving their address and name. This process would generate an email to the founders, containing the information given by the costumers, which they would use to call a cab company. This method did not require the creation of a robust system that tracks the location of the user, or that automatically finds a taxi driver based on the address of the costumer, making it easier and cheaper to validate the hypothesis.

Note: this image is one of the first MVP iterations I could find. It is not the first MVP of the company.
