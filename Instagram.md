<h2 align="left">Instagram</h2>

A social network focused on sharing photos and videos.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in sharing their meetings at public places.

**Description**: Instagram was first called Burbn, an app about sharing your experiences on public places, with gamifications like being able to score points when posting a meeting. The app was not successful. However, after some analysis and collecting some feedback, the founders realized that people enjoyed the photo-sharing feature a lot. Burbn then performed a Zoom-In pivot, changing its name to Instagram and focusing on one single feature of the original app, which was the possibility of sharing photographies. The founders believed that photo sharing was strong enough to sustain an entire social media, so they wanted to make it easy to share pictures, with straight forward filters that did not require any knowledge on photo editing.
