**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share folders with documents and pictures on their PC, with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

Use of casual language:
- The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people.
- Some hidden jokes were present in the video.
- This method made Drew look likable and relatable.

Video showed how to use the feature, and why it is useful for people:
- The video is almost like a tutorial, showing how the features work.
- It all works fast and simple, making it sell the idea of a well made product.

Advantages of this method:
- The video showed how the system would work, without the need to spend a lot of time and money to create the feature.
- It validades the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.
