A music streaming service.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in listening to their music on a single app that does not require you to download the songs and allows you to avoid the risk of dealing with viruses and wrong downloads.

**Description**: A desktop app that had one feature: music streaming. Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, the founders of Spotify, already knew music streaming was a validated hypothesis. However, they wanted to do it with a higher quality when compared to the market. They wanted their application to be faster, so they focused a lot on decreasing the latency of their system, to make it feel as smooth as possible. As time moved on, they added more features to the MVP to refine it to the quality they visioned.
