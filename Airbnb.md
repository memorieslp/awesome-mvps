<h2 align="left">Airbnb</h2>
An online marketplace for homestay experiences, where you stay in a house or apartment from another person, and not from a hotel company.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to provide their residences as a place for other people to stay.

**Description**: Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, the founders of Aribnb, arranged a room from their apartment to look like a proper space for people to sleep at, similar to a hotel. They realized the city they lived at, San Francisco, had lots of conferences, but hotels were often full and were expensive. They decided to fix that problem by making a website where people could sleep on other people's residences. However, that idea was expensive. The founders used a conference to test this idea, using their own apartment to simulate the experiment. 

After realizing that people had interest in it, they created a very simple website, but it was focused on people that wanted to attend tech conferences. After some testing and success, the founders started to test if people were willing to have strangers spend time at their residences, and they did that with the same focus on tech conferences. Only later, after a lot of tests and changes to their website, that the founders started to expand their costumers and remove this link between their website and tech conferences.
