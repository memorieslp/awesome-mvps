Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find shoes.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores. However, most of the backend was done manually. Nick Swinmurn, the founder, would visit shoe stores beforehand, taking pictures and checking the prices of the shoes, so he could add those details to his website. Once a product was ordered, Swinmurn would go back to the stores to buy the shoes, mailing them to the address of the costumer.
