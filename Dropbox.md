File hosting service

#### Type: Video
**Date**: 2008.

Link to the original mvp video, uploaded by theragax: https://youtu.be/7QmCUDHpNzE 

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share documents and pictures with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The mvp showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an oportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.
