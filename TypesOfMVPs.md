<h2 align="left">Types of MVPs</h2>

| **MVP**  | **Description** | **Examples**
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Landing Page** | A page on the internet with the goal of showing what is your product. It is often used as a complement to the the real product that is being developed, to help people understand what the product is about. In some cases, the Landing Page is created before the product even exists to see if people have interest in it| <a href="#buffer">Buffer</a> |
| **Crowdfunding** | The product is shown on a website where the target market can help funding the project, so this strategy is usually used when there is not enough money for the product to happen. In exchange, people that helped funding gain unique benefits, like being able to get in touch with the developers, give proper feedback and express their ideas, get a beta version of the product, or even getting the product for free depending on how much the person helped funding it. | <a href="#oculus-rift">Oculus Rift</a> |
