<h2 align="left">Types of MVPs</h2>

| MVP  | Description| Examples
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Video  | A video that shows your product, usually presenting its features while also selling why your idea is good deserves to be on the market | Dropbox  |
| Concierge  | The entire product is done manually by people, without a functional product | Food on the Table  |
| The Wizard of Oz | While the user can interact with the product, the backend is actually done by people without the user even noticing it | Zappos, Easy Taxi, Amazon |
| Piecemeal | It works like The Wizard of Oz, however the backend uses tools to facilitate the manual process | Nothing |
| Single Feature | The product only has one single feature, usually the one that is the most important and represents well the identity of the product | Facebook, Tinder, Instagram |
