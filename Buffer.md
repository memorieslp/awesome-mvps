A software that allows you to manage your social media accounts, like being able to schedule your posts and check their statistics (engagement with the community) 

#### Type: Landing Page
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: Some people would like to manage their multiple social medias through a single application

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The mvp showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an oportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.
