<!-- Buffer -->
<h2 align="left">Buffer</h2>
A software that allows you to manage your social media accounts, like being able to schedule your posts and check their statistics (engagement with the community) 

#### Type: Landing Page
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: Some people would like to manage their multiple social medias through a single application

**Description**: A 2 page website where the first page showed what Buffer was capable of doing, while the second one allowed the person to give their email for future informations about the product. However, the app did not even exist, and the only purpose of making a Landing Page was to see if people had interest in the app, allowing Joel Gascoigne, the founder of Buffer, to gather evidence about his idea being good (or not). The Landing Page was small, simple, and explained extremely well what the product was capable of doing, which means it did not require people to invest much time on the website.
