Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find shoes.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores. However, most of the backend was done manually. Nick Swinmurn, the founder, would visit shoe stores beforehand, taking pictures and checking the prices of the shoes, so he could add those details to his website. Once a product was ordered, Swinmurn would go back to the stores to buy the shoes, mailing them to the address of the costumer.

File hosting service

#### Type: Video
**Date**: 2008.

Link to the original mvp video, uploaded by theragax: https://youtu.be/7QmCUDHpNzE 

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share documents and pictures with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The mvp showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an oportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.

<!-- Facebook -->
<h2 align="left">Facebook</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Evolutionary
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: Students would like to share their university experiences though a social website that connects people.

**Description**: A social media website that allows students, from Harvard, to connect with people they've met at the university, sharing their experiences around the campus and creating discussions related to the institution. At first, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, created a website, in 2003, called Face Share, where people could vote which students were the most beautiful, and was mostly used as a joke. Harvard took the website down. However, it still worked as an inspiration for Zuckerberg to keep students engaged with each other through the internet, which lead to the creation of The Facebook, Mark's first real MVP.

<!-- Easy Taxi -->
<h2 align="left">Easy Taxi</h2>

Mobile App for taxi hailing.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that people would ask for a cab, with the backend done manually. A costumer would order a taxi through the Easy Taxi website, giving their address and name. This process would generate an email to the founders, containing the information given by the costumers, which they would use to call a cab company. This method did not require the creation of a robust system that tracks the location of the user, or that automatically finds a taxi driver based on the address of the costumer, making it easier and cheaper to validate the hypothesis.
