# Zappos

### Company: Zappos
Online shoe and clothing retailer store
### Type of MVP: Concierge
MVP created in 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find the shoes they want to.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores, however most of the backend is done manually.

What was done manually:
- The pictures of the shoes were taken by Nick Swinmurn, the founder, by visiting shoe stores. 
- Swinmurn would go to the real stores, buy the shoes, and send them to the costumer that bought the shoes on his online website.

Advantages of this method:
- Fast to test.
- No need to program and automate parts of the sales process.

This method would not scale well for a big store, however it was good enough to test the hypothesis.
