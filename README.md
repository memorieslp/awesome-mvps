Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type of MVP: The Wizard of Oz
MVP created in 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find the shoes they want to.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores, however most of the backend is done manually, like the pictures of the shoes that were taken by Nick Swinmurn, the founder, by visiting shoe stores. Swinmurn would also go to the real stores, buy the shoes, and send them to the costumer that bought the shoes on his online website.

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share folders with documents and pictures on their PC, with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

Use of casual language:
- The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people.
- Some hidden jokes were present in the video.
- This method made Drew look likable and relatable.

Video showed how to use the feature, and why it is useful for people:
- The video is almost like a tutorial, showing how the features work.
- It all works fast and simple, making it sell the idea of a well made product.

Advantages of this method:
- The video showed how the system would work, without the need to spend a lot of time and money to create the feature.
- It validades the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.
