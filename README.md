<!-- Zapos -->
<h2 align="left">Zappos</h2>
Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find shoes.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores. However, most of the backend was done manually. Nick Swinmurn, the founder, would visit shoe stores beforehand, taking pictures and checking the prices of the shoes, so he could add those details to his website. Once a product was ordered, Swinmurn would go back to the stores to buy the shoes, mailing them to the address of the costumer.

<!-- Dropbox -->
<h2 align="left">Dropbox</h2>
File hosting service

#### Type: Video
**Date**: 2008.

Link to the original mvp video, uploaded by theragax: https://youtu.be/7QmCUDHpNzE 

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share documents and pictures with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The mvp showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an oportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.

<!-- Facebook -->
<h2 align="left">Facebook</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Evolutionary
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: Students would like to share their university experiences though a social website that connects people.

**Description**: A social media website that allows students, from Harvard, to connect with people they've met at the university, sharing their experiences around the campus and creating discussions related to the institution. At first, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, created a website, in 2003, called Face Share, where people could vote which students were the most beautiful, and was mostly used as a joke. Harvard took the website down. However, it still worked as an inspiration for Zuckerberg to keep students engaged with each other through the internet, which lead to the creation of The Facebook, Mark's first real MVP.

Later on, Facebook decided to focus on being a social media for any person, and not just Harvard students, increasing the amount of features over time and adapting them to a wider public.

<!-- Tinder -->
<h2 align="left">Tinder</h2>

Online dating app.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to easily arrange a date and set up a meeting.

**Description**: An app that allows people to make profiles focused on dating. If two profiles like each other, they get a match, allowing them to talk to each other and arrange a real life date if they want to. Tinder was first called MatchBox, and its features barely changed over time, because it was a very focused and simple idea, that early on, proved to work with its success among university students. At first, you would give a like or dislike on another profile. However, only one year later after the first MVP, the developers changed the like and dislike buttons to a swipe feature, where you swipe right to like and left to dislike, giving it a unique feel that was not common at the time. Not only the swap feature made the process of showing interest to a person faster, but it also gave an identity to the app, making it more iconic.

<!-- Easy Taxi -->
<h2 align="left">Easy Taxi</h2>

Mobile App for taxi hailing.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that people would ask for a cab, with the backend done manually. A costumer would order a taxi through the Easy Taxi website, giving their address and name. This process would generate an email to the founders, containing the information given by the costumers, which they would use to call a cab company. This method did not require the creation of a robust system that tracks the location of the user, or that automatically finds a taxi driver based on the address of the costumer, making it easier and cheaper to validate the hypothesis.

<!-- Instagram -->
<h2 align="left">Instagram</h2>

A social network focused on sharing photos and videos.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in sharing their meetings at public places.

**Description**: Instagram was first called Burbn, an app about sharing your experiences on public places, with gamifications like being able to score points when posting a meeting. The app was not successful. However, after some analysis and collecting some feedback, the founders realized that people enjoyed the photo-sharing feature a lot. Burbn then performed a Zoom-In pivot, changing its name to Instagram and focusing on one single feature of the original app, which was the possibility of sharing photographies. The founders believed that photo sharing was strong enough to sustain an entire social media, so they wanted to make it easy to share pictures, with straight forward filters that did not require any knowledge on photo editing.

<!-- Food on the Table -->
<h2 align="left">Food on the Table</h2>

An app that helps you plan meals based on your own preferences and on the ingredients's prices near your home.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to have an app that shows them recipes for meals that they have interest in, while also showing nearby groceries that have the best prices for the ingredients they need.

**Description**: The MVP was a manual process, with no programing required or any use of external tools. The founders would talk to people, find out their preferences, go to the supermakets and grocery stores to check the prices of the ingredients, and deliver them to their clients. It started with one client, and slowly scalated to more and more people. The founders were able to learn the nuances of this project, by talking to people and learning how the process works in practice, while also not spending any time or money on programing a very ambitious and complex app that they did not know if it had a future and a place on the market.
