<!-- Description -->
Welcome to awesome-mvps, a repository with a Catalog of MVPs! 

<!-- What are MVPs? -->
<h2 align="left">What are MVPs?</h2>

MVPs are Minimum Viable Products, a simplified version of a finished product. The use of this term can vary depending on what people consider as "minimum". My favorite definition is the one from Eric Ries, the author of the Lean Startup book that is probably the most influential book about MVPs: 

*"A Minimum Viable Product is the version of a product that demands less effort to make, while also being able to provide the maximum amount of validating learning"*, Eric Ries from Lean Startup.

Steve Blank, another important figure that has discussed about MVPs and their importance, that is also the author of the famous book called "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses", gives a more technical point of view for what a MVP is:

*"The MVP is a group of features that is enough to release your product to the market"*, Steve Blank.

<!-- MVPs are part of a Learning Process -->
<h2 align="left">MVPs are part of a Learning Process</h2>

The main advantage of MVPs is that they are part of a process, called **Learning Process** by Ries, which can be simplified as: 
<li>Coming up with an idea (hypothesis) and a plan</li>
<li>Creating a MVP to test your hypothesis on the market</li>
<li>Gathering feedback from the users and learning from it</li>
<li>Coming up with a new hyphotesis, changing your current hypothesis to a new one, or adapting your current hypothesis</li>

The Learning Process is a cycle. Once you start to change your product according to the feedback you received, you have to create a new MVP or alter your current one so the users can try the MVP again and give you more feedback.

This process can vary depending on what type of product you are making and on the size and resources of your company.

<!-- Hypothesis and their importance for MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Hypothesis and their importance for MVPs</h2>

Hypothesis shape the identity of your product. They can describe your product fundamentally by proposing a solution to a problem the market has interest in solving, or they can be about how you solve said problem, or they can be a characteristic of your product.

The act of studying your hypothesis is called **hypothesis validation**. If your hypothesis is validated, then it means this characteristic of your product that is represented by the hypothesis has a market interested in it. This is why it is important to validate the more important hypothesis first... If you try to make a product based on a problem that the market has no interest in solving it, or if the solution to that problem is not being solved in a way that the market wants to, then it means you might need to fundamentally change your product or scrap it. 

<!-- Motivation for checking out this Catalog of MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Motivation for checking out this Catalog of MVPs</h2>

MVPs are those small effort products that are still able to validate hypothesis. It means that a MVP can help you learn if the identity of your product will have a market for it, without you spending a lot of time and money. However, knowing how your MVP should be made, and how to utilize well the Learning Process is not a trivial task.

The Catalog of MVPs presented on this repository has the goal of showing real life examples of how you can use MVPs to validate your product.

<!-- Types of MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Types of MVPs</h2>

| **MVP**  | **Description** | **Examples**
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Landing Page** | A page on the internet with the goal of showing what is your product. It is often used as a complement to the the real product that is being developed, to help people understand what the product is about. In some cases, the Landing Page is created before the product even exists to see if people have interest in it| <a href="#buffer">Buffer</a> |
| **Crowdfunding** | The product is shown on a website where the target market can help funding the project, so this strategy is usually used when there is not enough money for the product to happen. In exchange, people that helped funding gain unique benefits, like being able to get in touch with the developers, give proper feedback and express their ideas, get a beta version of the product, or even getting the product for free depending on how much the person helped funding it. | <a href="#oculus-rift">Oculus Rift</a> |
| **Video**  | A video that shows your product, usually presenting its features while also selling why your idea is good deserves to be on the market | <a href="#dropbox">Dropbox</a> |
| **Concierge**  | The entire product is done manually by people, without a functional product | <a href="#food-on-the-table">Food on the Table</a>, <a href="#airbnb">Airbnb</a> |
| **The Wizard of Oz** | While the user can interact with the product, the backend is actually done by people without the user even noticing it | <a href="#zappos">Zappos</a>, <a href="#easy-taxi">Easy Taxi</a>, <a href="#amazon">Amazon</a> |
| **Piecemeal** | It works like The Wizard of Oz, however the backend uses tools to facilitate the manual process | <a href="#groupon">Groupon</a> |
| **Simple App** | The product has the least amount of features necessary to represent well the identity of the product | <a href="#facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="#tinder">Tinder</a>, <a href="#instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="#twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="#spotify">Spotify</a> |

<!-- Zappos -->
<h2 align="left">Zappos</h2>
Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find shoes.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores. However, most of the backend was done manually. Nick Swinmurn, the founder, would visit shoe stores beforehand, taking pictures and checking the prices of the shoes, so he could add those details to his website. Once a product was ordered, Swinmurn would go back to the stores to buy the shoes, mailing them to the address of the costumer.

<!-- Dropbox -->
<h2 align="left">Dropbox</h2>
File hosting service

#### Type: Video
**Date**: 2008.

Link to the original mvp video, uploaded by theragax: https://youtu.be/7QmCUDHpNzE 

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share documents and pictures with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The MVP showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an oportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.

**Features**: The prototype had the ability to place your folders on the Dropbox folder to upload the content to the cloud storage system. You could see all the files that were in sync with Dropbox by checking their website. Although functional, the prototype was not ready for the public, so presenting the early stage development version of the product through a video could give the idea of a fast and optimized product, the exact characteristics that Drew Houston believed would make his product stand out compared to the competition.

<!-- Facebook -->
<h2 align="left">Facebook</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: Students would like to share their university experiences though a social website that connects people.

**Description**: A social media website that allows students, from Harvard, to connect with people they've met at the university, sharing their experiences around the campus and creating discussions related to the institution. At first, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, created a website, in 2003, called Face Share, where people could vote which students were the most beautiful, and was mostly used as a joke. Harvard took the website down. However, it still worked as an inspiration for Zuckerberg to keep students engaged with each other through the internet, which lead to the creation of The Facebook, Mark's first real MVP.

Later on, Facebook decided to focus on being a social media for any person, and not just Harvard students, increasing the amount of features over time and adapting them to a wider public.

**Features**: The Facebook allowed students to make an account with a profile picture and descriptions about themselves. Users could add and remove friends and engage with groups by having discussions about their time inside the university. It created a sense of community for the students and it felt like a social exntension from their time at the campus.

<!-- Tinder -->
<h2 align="left">Tinder</h2>

Online dating app.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to easily arrange a date and set up a meeting.

**Description**: An app that allows people to make profiles focused on dating. If two profiles like each other, they get a match, allowing them to talk to each other and arrange a real life date if they want to. Tinder was first called MatchBox, and its features barely changed over time, because it was a very focused and simple idea, that early on, proved to work with its success among university students. At first, you would give a like or dislike on another profile. However, only one year later after the first MVP, the developers changed the like and dislike buttons to a swipe feature, where you swipe right to like and left to dislike, giving it a unique feel that was not common at the time. Not only the swap feature made the process of showing interest to a person faster, but it also gave an identity to the app, making it more iconic.

![tinder_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234894559-d9ca572b-d4c9-4067-9c89-d2e77c55e545.png)

<!-- Easy Taxi -->
<h2 align="left">Easy Taxi</h2>

Mobile App for taxi hailing.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that people would ask for a cab, with the backend done manually. A costumer would order a taxi through the Easy Taxi website, giving their address and name. This process would generate an email to the founders, containing the information given by the costumers, which they would use to call a cab company. This method did not require the creation of a robust system that tracks the location of the user, or that automatically finds a taxi driver based on the address of the costumer, making it easier and cheaper to validate the hypothesis.

![easy-taxi_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/233426377-72b3c2e7-f625-4706-a838-601eac4f1d83.png)

<!-- Instagram -->
<h2 align="left">Instagram</h2>

A social network focused on sharing photos and videos.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in sharing their meetings at public places.

**Description**: Instagram was first called Burbn, an app about sharing your experiences on public places, with gamifications like being able to score points when posting a meeting. The app was not successful. However, after some analysis and collecting some feedback, the founders realized that people enjoyed the photo-sharing feature a lot. Burbn then performed a Zoom-In pivot, changing its name to Instagram and focusing on one single feature of the original app, which was the possibility of sharing photographies. The founders believed that photo sharing was strong enough to sustain an entire social media, so they wanted to make it easy to share pictures, with straight forward filters that did not require any knowledge on photo editing.

![instagram_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234920799-87fcaa62-66f4-4989-956c-6dcfeaf91519.png)

<!-- Food on the Table -->
<h2 align="left">Food on the Table</h2>

An app that helps you plan meals based on your own preferences and on the ingredients's prices near your home.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to have an app that shows them recipes for meals that they have interest in, while also showing nearby groceries that have the best prices for the ingredients they need.

**Description**: The MVP was a manual process, with no programing required or any use of external tools. The founders would talk to people, find out their preferences, go to the supermakets and grocery stores to check the prices of the ingredients, and deliver them to their clients. It started with one client, and slowly scalated to more and more people. The founders were able to learn the nuances of this project, by talking to people and learning how the process works in practice, while also not spending any time or money on programing a very ambitious and complex app that they did not know if it had a future and a place on the market.

![food-on-the-table_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234931770-66526bc5-b28d-4463-a086-54259a891b96.png)

<!-- Amazon -->
<h2 align="left">Amazon</h2>
Most known for being an online retailer of many types of products, although Amazon also offers services such as cloud computing and digital streaming.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1995.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in buying multiple products online, without the need to visit stores.

Jeff Bezos, the founder, started testing this hyphothesis by scaling it down to books only.

**Description**: An online retailer store that sells books, however part of the backend was done manually. Jeff Bezos believed that online retailer stores was the future of the industry and the internet, so he started selling books online, because there were many books, and they were easy to buy and ship, they did not require big investiments and they were an extremely popular product. The first Amazon website is considered to be a Single Feature MVP, since all it did was selling books online, although Jeff Bezos would also physically buy the books and mail them to the costumers.

Bezos would add more types of products over the time, slowly validating his main hypothesis.

![amazon_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/235662931-99e8336f-4b37-4a70-be7b-d0706a49fdd3.png)

<!-- Groupon -->
<h2 align="left">Groupon</h2>

An e-commerce marketplace where you can hire and visit local services.

#### Type: Piecemeal
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to find places to visit and services to hire with ease and with a cheaper price.

**Description**: A website where people receives coupons on their emails, however the backend was done manually with the help of external tools. Groupon was first called The First, and it was a website where people would use social media for a cause or common goal. Andrew Mason, the founder, realized that people were using The First to make a group of people buy a product with the goal of gaining a discount. A Costumer Need pivot happened, where Andrew decided to solve a problem from his costumers that he did not think about, which was the ability to get discounts for products and services. Groupon was created and it was very simple. All it did, at first, was to send emails to the people that worked on the same building as Andrew, with a coupon discount to the pizza restaurant that was also present on the same building. It later on scalated to a website where part of the backend used a script that would automatically send the coupons to the buyier.

<!-- Twitter -->
<h2 align="left">Twitter</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily get in touch with friends through fast messages, that are shared to all the user's followers.

**Description**: A social media website that allows people to follow people and write short messages that can be seen by other people. The feed of this website had a list of messages from people you follow. The idea started as just a fast way for employees to comunicated with each other, and after seein the success of this idea amongst the company, Jack Dorsey decided to make a proper social media, that was originally called twttr. The idea was original and not seein anywhere else on the internet, so it was hard to define, at the time, what twttr actually was. As time passed, it became clear Twitter would also be about spreading information between groups of people that are interested on the same topic, moving away from just being about updating your friends about your daily lifes.

![twitter_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/235714298-65d2c34c-6316-4ecd-bce9-a3886da7671d.png)

<!-- Buffer -->
<h2 align="left">Buffer</h2>
A software that allows you to manage your social media accounts, like being able to schedule your posts and check their statistics (engagement with the community) 

#### Type: Landing Page
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: Some people would like to manage their multiple social medias through a single application

**Description**: A 2 page website where the first page showed what Buffer was capable of doing, while the second one allowed the person to give their email for future informations about the product. However, the app did not even exist, and the only purpose of making a Landing Page was to see if people had interest in the app, allowing Joel Gascoigne, the founder of Buffer, to gather evidence about his idea being good (or not). The Landing Page was small, simple, and explained extremely well what the product was capable of doing, which means it did not require people to invest much time on the website.

![buffer_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/236283241-35a975a0-766e-434d-b20a-3b705d5b8064.png)

<!-- Oculus Rift -->
<h2 align="left">Oculus Rift</h2>
A virtual reality gaming device.

#### Type: Crowdfunding
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: Gamers have interest in buying a Virtual Reality headset. 

**Description**: An annoucement for crowdfunging a Virtual Reality (VR) headset at the Kickstarter website. The first prototype was made in 2011 by Palmer Luckey, then it was presented at one of the biggest gaming events at the time called E3, in 2012. The product became famous and received positive feedback at the event, so Palmer decided to crowdfund it, given that he had no resources and money to accomplish his goals. VRs were a new technology at the time and were not accessible by most people, so a lot of gamers had interest in seein this product have success.

<!-- Spotify -->
<h2 align="left">Spotify</h2>
A music streaming service.

#### Type: Single Feature
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in listening to their music on a single app that does not require you to download the songs and allows you to avoid the risk of dealing with viruses and wrong downloads.

**Description**: A desktop app that had one feature: music streaming. Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, the founders of Spotify, already knew music streaming was a validated hypothesis. However, they wanted to do it with a higher quality when compared to the market. They wanted their application to be faster, so they focused a lot on decreasing the latency of their system, to make it feel as smooth as possible. As time moved on, they added more features to the MVP to refine it to the quality they visioned.

![spotify_mvp](https://github.com/memorieslp/awesome-mvps/assets/42478443/b588041f-eb00-4735-a65f-329b723e7879)

<!-- Airbnb -->
<h2 align="left">Airbnb</h2>
An online marketplace for homestay experiences, where you stay in a house or apartment from another person, and not from a hotel company.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to provide their residences as a place for other people to stay.

**Description**: Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, the founders of Aribnb, arranged a room from their apartment to look like a proper space for people to sleep at, similar to a hotel. They realized the city they lived at, San Francisco, had lots of conferences, but hotels were often full and were expensive. They decided to fix that problem by making a website where people could sleep on other people's residences. However, that idea was expensive. The founders used a conference to test this idea, using their own apartment to simulate the experiment. 

After realizing that people had interest in it, they created a very simple website, but it was focused on people that wanted to attend tech conferences. After some testing and success, the founders started to test if people were willing to have strangers spend time at their residences, and they did that with the same focus on tech conferences. Only later, after a lot of tests and changes to their website, that the founders started to expand their costumers and remove this link between their website and tech conferences.
