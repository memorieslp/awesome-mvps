Welcome to awesome-mvps, a repository with a Catalog of MVPs! 

<!-- What are MVPs? -->
<h2 align="left">What are MVPs?</h2>

MVPs, or Minimum Viable Products, refer to simplified versions of finished products. The interpretation of this term may vary depending on what individuals consider as 'minimum.' My favorite definition comes from Eric Ries, the author of the influential book 'The Lean Startup,':

*â€™A Minimum Viable Product is the version of a product that requires less effort to create, while still providing the maximum amount of validating learningâ€™*, - Eric Ries, 'The Lean Startup'.

Steve Blank, another important figure who has discussed MVPs and their significance, and the author of the renowned book 'The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,' offers a more technical perspective on what an MVP entails:

*'The MVP is a group of features that is sufficient for releasing your product to the market.'* - Steve Blank.

<!-- MVPs are part of a Learning Process -->
<h2 align="left">MVPs are part of a Learning Process</h2>

The main advantage of MVPs is that they are part of a process, called **Learning Process** by Ries, which can be simplified as: 
<li>Coming up with an idea (hypothesis) and a plan</li>
<li>Creating a MVP to test your hypotheses on the market</li>
<li>Gathering feedback from the users and learning from it</li>
<li>Coming up with a new hypotheses, changing your current hypotheses to a new one, or adapting your current hypotheses</li>

The Learning Process is a cycle. Once you begin to make changes to your product based on the feedback you received, you need to create a new MVP or modify your existing one so that users can try it again and provide further feedback.

This process can vary depending on the type of product you are developing and the size and resources of your company.

<!-- Hypotheses and their importance for MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Hypotheses and their importance for MVPs</h2>

Hypotheses shape the identity of your product. They can fundamentally describe your product by proposing a solution to a problem that the market is interested in solving. Alternatively, they can focus on **how** you solve that problem, or your hypothesis can simply represent a characteristic of your product

The process of studying your hypotheses is known as **hypothesis validation**. When your hypothesis is validated, it indicates that the characteristic of your product represented by the hypothesis has a market interested in it. This is why it is crucial to validate the most important hypotheses first. If you attempt to create a product based on a problem that the market has no interest in solving, or if the solution to that problem does not align with what the market desires, it may be necessary to fundamentally change or abandon your product.

MVPs are small-scale products that require minimal effort but can still validate hypotheses. They serve as a means to determine if the identity of your product has a market without requiring significant time and financial investment. However, understanding how to create an effective MVP and utilize the Learning Process is not an easy task.

The Catalog of MVPs presented in this repository aims to provide real-life examples of how you can employ MVPs to validate your product.

<!-- Types of MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Types of MVPs</h2>

| **MVP**  | **Description** | **Examples**
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Landing Page** | A Landing Page is a web page designed to showcase and explain your product. It is commonly used as a supplement to the actual product being developed, helping people understand its purpose and features. In certain cases, a Landing Page may be created even before the product exists, serving as a way to gauge interest and determine if there is demand for it. | <a href="#buffer">Buffer</a> |
| **Crowdfunding** | The product is showcased on a crowdfunding website, where the target market can contribute funds to support the project. This strategy is typically employed when there is a lack of sufficient funds to bring the product to fruition. In return for their support, individuals who contribute to the funding campaign receive exclusive benefits. These benefits may include opportunities to communicate with the developers, provide valuable feedback, share ideas, gain early access to a beta version of the product, or even receive the product for free, depending on the level of their financial contribution. | <a href="#oculus-rift">Oculus Rift</a> |
| **Video**  | A video showcasing your product, presenting its features, and effectively conveying that the value of your idea is an essential asset for the market. | <a href="#dropbox">Dropbox</a> |
| **Concierge**  | The entire product is executed manually by individuals without a functioning product. | <a href="#food-on-the-table">Food on the Table</a>, <a href="#airbnb">Airbnb</a> |
| **The Wizard of Oz** | Although the user can interact with the product, the backend is actually done by people without the user's awareness. | <a href="#zappos">Zappos</a>, <a href="#easy-taxi">Easy Taxi</a>, <a href="#amazon">Amazon</a> |
| **Piecemeal** | It works like The Wizard of Oz, however the backend uses tools to facilitate the manual process | <a href="#groupon">Groupon</a> |

<!-- Zappos -->
<h2 align="left">Zappos</h2>
Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retail store for shoes would significantly simplify the process of purchasing desired footwear, eliminating the need for individuals to visit multiple physical stores.

**Description**: A website that specializes in reselling shoes sourced from various shoe stores. However, a significant portion of the backend operations is carried out manually. The founder, Nick Swinmurn, personally visits shoe stores in advance, capturing pictures and verifying prices of the shoes. These details are then added to the website's listings. When a customer places an order, Swinmurn revisits the respective stores, purchases the shoes, and subsequently ships them to the customer's address.

**Features**: The website provided customers with the ability to view shoe pictures, prices, and additional details such as size and brand, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions. Furthermore, there was a streamlined delivery system in place where customers could provide their address, and Zappos would handle shipping the shoes directly to them. While the scale of these features was relatively small, it presented a significant challenge for Nick Swinmurn to ensure that the process appeared automated and seamless. Due to his manual efforts, Nick focused on incorporating only essential features that were necessary to test his hypothesis, avoiding any unnecessary work.

<!-- Dropbox -->
<h2 align="left">Dropbox</h2>
File hosting service

#### Type: Video
**Date**: 2008.

Link to the original mvp video, uploaded by theragax: https://youtu.be/7QmCUDHpNzE 

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share documents and pictures with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The MVP showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an opportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.

**Features**: The prototype had the ability to place your folders on the Dropbox folder to upload the content to the cloud storage system. You could see all the files that were in sync with Dropbox by checking their website. Although functional, the prototype was not ready for the public, so presenting the early stage development version of the product through a video could suggest the idea of a fast and optimized product, the exact characteristics that Drew Houston believed would make his product stand out compared to the competition.

<!-- Facebook -->
<h2 align="left">Facebook</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: Students would like to share their university experiences through a social website that connects people.

**Description**: The initial concept was a social media website specifically designed for Harvard students to connect with others they had encountered on campus, fostering discussions and sharing experiences related to the university. In 2003, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, created a website called Face Share, which allowed people to vote on the most beautiful students at Harvard. However, it was primarily intended as a joke and was eventually taken down by the university. Nevertheless, this experience served as inspiration for Zuckerberg to explore the idea of utilizing the internet to facilitate student engagement, leading to the development of his first true minimum viable product (MVP) called The Facebook.

As time progressed, Facebook expanded its focus to become a social media platform for individuals beyond just Harvard students. It gradually introduced additional features and adapted them to cater to a broader audience.

**Features**: Facebook allowed students to create accounts with profile pictures and descriptions about themselves. Users could add and remove friends, as well as engage with groups to have discussions about their university experiences. It created a sense of community for the students and felt like a social extension of their time on campus.

![facebook_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234598165-ac972af8-8bd6-4eb7-a9ba-d9d50145f521.png)

<!-- Tinder -->
<h2 align="left">Tinder</h2>

Online dating app.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to easily arrange a date and set up a meeting.

**Description**: The app in question is a dating-focused platform where users create profiles to connect with potential matches. If two profiles express mutual interest, they achieve a match, granting them the ability to communicate and potentially arrange an in-person date. Originally named MatchBox, the app eventually evolved into what we now know as Tinder. Its core features remained largely unchanged over time due to its initial success and the effectiveness of its focused and simplistic approach. From its early days, the app demonstrated great appeal among university students. Initially, users could express their interest by liking or disliking other profiles. However, within just one year of its first minimum viable product (MVP), the developers introduced a unique and iconic feature: the swipe. Replacing the like and dislike buttons, the swipe feature allowed users to swipe right to express interest (like) or swipe left to indicate disinterest (dislike). This innovation not only accelerated the process of expressing interest in another person but also gave Tinder its distinctive identity. The swipe feature set Tinder apart from other dating apps at the time, contributing to its widespread popularity.

**Features**: Users of the app had the ability to create profiles, providing some information about themselves and adding photographs. The app featured a like and dislike function, enabling users to express their preference by giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to other profiles. If two profiles mutually liked each other, a match would be established. This would trigger a notification for both users, indicating their mutual interest and granting them the opportunity to initiate a chat, allowing them to get to know each other better. It's important to note that the fundamental aspects of searching for other users and the matching feature still define the app's identity today.
During its early stages, the app had a limited reach, and therefore did not incorporate a proximity feature to display the geographical distance between profiles. However, as the app began to expand across the country and eventually worldwide, the addition of a proximity feature became necessary for users to connect with others in their vicinity.

![tinder_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234894559-d9ca572b-d4c9-4067-9c89-d2e77c55e545.png)

<!-- Easy Taxi -->
<h2 align="left">Easy Taxi</h2>

Mobile App for taxi hailing.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that served as a platform for individuals to request a cab, with the backend being handled manually. Customers would place their taxi orders through the Easy Taxi website by providing their address and name. This generated an email notification sent to the founders, containing the customer's provided information. The founders would then use this information to contact a cab company and arrange the pick-up.This approach eliminated the need for the development of a complex system that tracks the user's location or automatically assigns a taxi driver based on the customer's address. By utilizing this manual process, the founders were able to validate their hypothesis in a simpler and cost-effective manner, without the requirement for a sophisticated infrastructure.

**Features**: The website had a single feature, which allowed users to call a taxi to their location by providing some basic information such as their name, email, location, destination, and even the color of their outfit. Once the details were submitted, users simply had to wait for the cab to arrive. While the website provided a level of convenience to customers, it did require some effort as users had to enter their personal information each time they requested a cab. Additionally, the user interface was primarily designed for desktop usage, which limited the overall user experience. Although the convenience provided by the website was not at the level the founders of Easy Taxi aspired to deliver to their customers, it was sufficient for testing their hypothesis. The focus at that stage was to determine if their concept would resonate with users and meet their needs.

![easy-taxi_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/233426377-72b3c2e7-f625-4706-a838-601eac4f1d83.png)

<!-- Instagram -->
<h2 align="left">Instagram</h2>

A social network focused on sharing photos and videos.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in sharing their meetings at public places.

**Description**: Initially known as Burbn, the app aimed to enable users to share their experiences at public places while incorporating gamification elements such as scoring points for posting a meeting. However, Burbn did not achieve significant success. Following a careful analysis of user feedback, the founders identified that the photo-sharing feature was particularly well-received by users. This realization led to a strategic shift known as the Zoom-In pivot, resulting in a rebranding of the app as Instagram and a narrowed focus on the photo-sharing functionality. Recognizing the strong appeal of photo sharing, the founders sought to make the process of sharing pictures easy and accessible to all users. They introduced straightforward filters that did not require any specialized knowledge of photo editing. By simplifying the photo-sharing experience and emphasizing user-friendly features, the founders believed that Instagram could thrive as a standalone social media platform centered around visual content.

**Features**: Users had the ability to create profiles on Instagram, providing personal descriptions and profile photos to represent themselves to their added friends. The platform featured a feed that displayed photographs posted by their friends. These pictures could undergo simple alterations such as resizing, adjusting saturation and colors, and applying various filters that could significantly change the tone and ambiance of the image. This allowed users to easily modify their photographs without the need for a complex photo editor like Photoshop, making it accessible to individuals without professional editing skills.The ability to like your friend's photo and make comments made users engage with each other by sharing their thoughts.

<!-- Food on the Table -->
<h2 align="left">Food on the Table</h2>

An app that helps you plan meals based on your own preferences and on the ingredients's prices near your home.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in having an app that provides them with recipes for meals they are interested in, while also displaying nearby grocery stores that offer the best prices for the required ingredients.

**Description**: The MVP of the app was developed as a manual process, without the need for programming or external tools. The founders personally interacted with users, gathered their preferences, visited supermarkets and grocery stores to check ingredient prices, and delivered the items to their clients. The initial phase began with a single client and gradually expanded with more customers. Through this hands-on approach, the founders gained valuable insights into the project's intricacies, learning about the practicalities involved and avoiding unnecessary time and financial investment in developing a complex app without a clear market demand or future prospects.

**Features**: The process involved customers sharing their preferences, enabling the founders to create customized recipes and identify the locations with the best ingredient prices. The founders would then physically visit the grocery stores and supermarkets to gather the necessary ingredients. These ingredients, along with detailed cooking instructions, would be delivered directly to the customer's residence. This approach made the concept highly appealing to individuals interested in cooking, as it eliminated the need for customers to personally visit stores and allowed them to simply await the delivery. In this MVP, there was no specific feature that needed to be implemented in an application. Rather, it was an abstraction of the real product.

![food-on-the-table_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234931770-66526bc5-b28d-4463-a086-54259a891b96.png)

<!-- Amazon -->
<h2 align="left">Amazon</h2>
Most known for being an online retailer of many types of products, although Amazon also offers services such as cloud computing and digital streaming.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1995.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in buying multiple products online, without the need to visit stores.

Jeff Bezos, the founder, started testing this hypothesis by scaling it down to books only.

**Description**: An online retailer store was established by Jeff Bezos, initially focused on selling books. Bezos recognized the potential of online retail as the future of the industry and the internet. Books were chosen as the initial product due to their abundance, ease of purchase and shipment, and widespread popularity. The first Amazon website is an extremely straightforward website, since all it did was sell books online, although Jeff Bezos would also physically buy the books and mail them to the customers.

Over time, Bezos expanded the range of products available on Amazon's platform, gradually validating his core hypothesis about the potential of online retail.

**Features**: The website provided customers with the ability to browse and select books for purchase, which would then be delivered to their homes. The search system initially catered specifically to books, as it was the only product offered. As Amazon expanded its product range, the search functionality gradually became more robust to accommodate the growing inventory. In the early stages, the front page of the website focused on positioning Amazon as the ideal destination for book purchases. It provided simple explanations about the website's purpose and the benefits it offered. This was necessary because, at the time, online retail stores were relatively unfamiliar to customers, and Amazon had to educate them about its unique value proposition. As Amazon evolved and introduced additional product categories, the layout of the website underwent changes to reflect the expanded offerings and emphasize that Amazon was more than just a book retailer.

![amazon_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/235662931-99e8336f-4b37-4a70-be7b-d0706a49fdd3.png)

<!-- Groupon -->
<h2 align="left">Groupon</h2>

An e-commerce marketplace where you can hire and visit local services.

#### Type: Piecemeal
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to find places to visit and services to hire with ease and with a cheaper price.

**Description**: A website where people receive coupons on their emails, however the backend was done manually with the help of external tools. Groupon was first called The Point, and it was a website where people utilized social media to support causes or work towards common goals. However, Andrew Mason, the founder, recognized that users were leveraging the platform to form groups and collectively purchase products with the aim of obtaining discounts. A Customer Need pivot happened, where Andrew decided to solve a problem from his customers that he did not think about, which was the ability to get discounts for products and services. Groupon started as a simple solution. Initially, it would manually send emails to individuals working in the same building as Andrew, offering them coupon discounts for the pizza restaurant located in the same building. However, as Groupon gained traction, the backend operations evolved. External tools and scripts were incorporated to automate the process of sending coupons to buyers, streamlining the website's operations and scaling its coupon delivery system.

**Features**: The Point boasted a range of features. Users could create accounts, explore and join campaigns, as well as establish their own campaigns. Additionally, they could participate in communities to engage in discussions related to these campaigns. In contrast, the initial MVP for Groupon was significantly simpler. It's only feature was the ability to send emails to Andrew's colleagues, offering them discount coupons. However, as Groupon progressed, it evolved into a more advanced versionâ€”an MVP in the form of a Simple App. This iteration introduced features such as coupon search functionality, enabling users to find available coupons for various products and services. The website abstracted the concept of a physical coupon by presenting discounted products and services directly, with the discount itself acting as the virtual coupon that customers could utilize for savings.

<!-- Twitter -->
<h2 align="left">Twitter</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share and discuss their interests with other people within a community.

**Description**: A social media website that allowed users to follow others and share short messages that could be viewed by their followers. The idea emerged as just a fast way for employees to communicate with each other, and after seeing the success of this idea amongst the company, Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, decided to transform it into a full-fledged social media platform, initially called twttr. During its early stages, the nature of twttr was somewhat elusive, as the concept of sharing brief updates in a public forum was relatively novel and hadn't been widely seen on the internet before. However, over time, Twitter began to establish its identity as a platform for disseminating information among groups of people with shared interests. It evolved beyond solely being a platform for personal updates among friends and embraced its role in facilitating discussions and information-sharing within specific communities.

**Features**: The website allowed users to create accounts and customize their profiles to some extent. The term "follower" was used to signify that the platform focused on people sharing common interests rather than just connecting with friends. Users could post short texts, encouraging them to share their thoughts and experiences throughout the day, which would appear on the feeds of their followers. While many users utilized Twitter for updating their friends on their daily lives, the platform also facilitated discussions on various topics of interest, such as movies, games, and books. This led to the formation of connections between users who shared common interests, expanding the social aspect beyond personal relationships.

Twitter's uniqueness prompted users to come up with creative ways to work around certain missing features, like the absence of a reply function. Users would indicate whom they were addressing by mentioning them explicitly, akin to addressing someone in a letter. Some even resorted to copying and pasting the comment they were replying to, ensuring proper context. After a while, the community even standardized the way users reply to each other.

To capture the essence of Twitter's distinct identity, the front page of the website was designed to explain its purpose while utilizing internet slangs, and common internet expressions like "rly" (for "really") and "imo" (for "in my opinion") were used to emphasize the platform's focus on concise and casual messaging. Additionally, Twitter was designed to be accessible both on desktop and mobile devices, enabling users to update their activities and engage with others at any time during the day.

![twitter_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/235714298-65d2c34c-6316-4ecd-bce9-a3886da7671d.png)

<!-- Buffer -->
<h2 align="left">Buffer</h2>
A software that allows you to manage your social media accounts, like being able to schedule your posts and check their statistics (engagement with the community) 

#### Type: Landing Page
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: Some people find it convenient to have a single application for managing multiple social media accounts.

**Description**: A two-page website was created for Buffer, where the first page showcased the capabilities of the product, while the second page provided an option for visitors to submit their email address to receive future information about the app. However, it's important to note that the app itself did not exist at that point. The purpose of creating this Landing Page was to gauge interest in the app and gather evidence to determine if the idea had potential. The Landing Page was designed to be concise, straightforward, and effectively communicated the features and benefits of the product, ensuring that visitors didn't need to invest much time in exploring the website.

**Features**: The webpage first explained exactly what the product was capable of doing, but in a very concise way by giving one simple example of how you could use the application, without trying to explain every single detail in depth. The idea was that one good example would interest people more than trying to give a lot of technical terms. The second page would ask for the email of the people that had interest in the product, so they could receive new information about Buffer later.

![buffer_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/236283241-35a975a0-766e-434d-b20a-3b705d5b8064.png)

<!-- Oculus Rift -->
<h2 align="left">Oculus Rift</h2>
A virtual reality gaming device.

#### Type: Crowdfunding
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: Gamers have interest in buying a Virtual Reality headset. 

**Description**: An announcement for crowdfunding a Virtual Reality (VR) headset on the Kickstarter website. The first prototype was made in 2011 by Palmer Luckey. It was then presented at one of the biggest gaming events of the time called E3, in 2012. The product gained fame and received positive feedback at the event, prompting Palmer to decide on crowdfunding. He lacked the necessary resources and funds to achieve his goals. As VR technology was still new and inaccessible to most people, there was significant interest from gamers in seeing this product succeed.

**Features**: Oculus Rift utilized the Kickstarter website to showcase its prototype, and the crowdfunding page featured various elements such as project explanations, funding goals, and the benefits associated with contributing based on different funding levels. The primary aim was to provide a clear understanding of the product and its underlying technology, with a strong emphasis on the promise of bringing and popularizing Virtual Reality on the PC platform.

![oculus-rift_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/236466646-7ca84f38-1627-4bca-9c55-4eab0ee273b6.png)

<!-- Spotify -->
<h2 align="left">Spotify</h2>
A music streaming service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in listening to their music on a single app that does not require you to download the songs and allows you to avoid the risk of dealing with viruses and wrong downloads.

**Description**: A desktop app was developed by the founders of Spotify, Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, with the primary feature being music streaming. They recognized that music streaming was a validated hypothesis, but they aimed to provide a higher quality experience compared to existing options in the market. A key focus of their development efforts was to reduce latency in their system, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience. Over time, they continued to enhance the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by incorporating additional features, refining it to match their vision of quality.

**Features**: In the earlier stages of Spotify, even prior to its public release, the app had limited functionality, allowing users to listen only to a few songs that were hard-coded into the program. This served as a means for Daniel and Martin to practice and refine their approach to creating a product with superior performance compared to their competitors. The early beta versions of Spotify focused on enabling users to search for songs and listen to them, with a remarkable speed that gave the impression of having entire discographies stored on their hard drives. This exceptional performance quality set Spotify apart from other streaming services available at the time. As Spotify progressed, one of the first notable features added to the app after its initial release were the ability to create personalized playlists and the option to download songs for offline listening. These features helped solidify Spotify's position as a distinctive and sophisticated music streaming service.

<!-- Airbnb -->
<h2 align="left">Airbnb</h2>
An online marketplace for homestay experiences, where you stay in a house or apartment from another person, and not from a hotel company.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to provide their residences as a place for other people to stay.

**Description**: Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, the founders of Airbnb, arranged a room in their apartment to resemble a proper space for people to sleep, much like a hotel room. They recognized that their city, San Francisco, hosted numerous conferences, but hotels were frequently fully booked and costly. To address this problem, they conceived the idea of creating a website where individuals could stay in other people's homes. However, implementing this concept required significant financial resources. As a way to test the idea, the founders utilized their own home as a lodging for people to sleep at.

**Features**: The founders initially made a simple announcement promoting their apartment as a lodging option for a specific tech conference taking place in the near future. Upon observing the positive response from people, they decided to create a basic website tailored to individuals attending tech conferences, in order to streamline the process. The website primarily featured their own apartment and allowed visitors to select the duration of their stay. Recognizing the demand for more affordable accommodations compared to hotels, the founders began testing the willingness of people to host strangers in their own homes, thus paving the way for expansion beyond their own apartment. They allowed customers to choose from various registered residences throughout the city. As both sides of their target market expressed interest in the idea, the founders started to broaden their customer base and gradually phased out the association between their website and tech conferences.
