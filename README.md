Welcome to awesome-mvps, a repository with a Catalog of MVPs! 

<!-- What are MVPs? -->
<h2 align="left">What are MVPs?</h2>

MVPs, or Minimum Viable Products, refer to simplified versions of finished products. The interpretation of this term may vary depending on what individuals consider as 'minimum.' My favorite definition comes from Eric Ries, the author of the influential book 'The Lean Startup,':

*â€™A Minimum Viable Product is the version of a product that requires less effort to create, while still providing the maximum amount of validating learningâ€™*, - Eric Ries, 'The Lean Startup'.

Steve Blank, another important figure who has discussed MVPs and their significance, and the author of the renowned book 'The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,' offers a more technical perspective on what an MVP entails:

*'The MVP is a group of features that is sufficient for releasing your product to the market.'* - Steve Blank.

<!-- MVPs are part of a Learning Process -->
<h2 align="left">MVPs are part of a Learning Process</h2>

The main advantage of MVPs is that they are part of a process, called **Learning Process** by Ries, which can be simplified as: 
<li>Coming up with an idea (hypothesis) and a plan</li>
<li>Creating a MVP to test your hypotheses on the market</li>
<li>Gathering feedback from the users and learning from it</li>
<li>Coming up with a new hypotheses, changing your current hypotheses to a new one, or adapting your current hypotheses</li>

The Learning Process is a cycle. Once you begin to make changes to your product based on the feedback you received, you need to create a new MVP or modify your existing one so that users can try it again and provide further feedback.

This process can vary depending on the type of product you are developing and the size and resources of your company.

<!-- Hypotheses and their importance for MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Hypotheses and their importance for MVPs</h2>

Hypotheses shape the identity of your product. They can fundamentally describe your product by proposing a solution to a problem that the market is interested in solving. Alternatively, they can focus on **how** you solve that problem, or your hypothesis can simply represent a characteristic of your product

The process of studying your hypotheses is known as **hypothesis validation**. When your hypothesis is validated, it indicates that the characteristic of your product represented by the hypothesis has a market interested in it. This is why it is crucial to validate the most important hypotheses first. If you attempt to create a product based on a problem that the market has no interest in solving, or if the solution to that problem does not align with what the market desires, it may be necessary to fundamentally change or abandon your product.

MVPs are small-scale products that require minimal effort but can still validate hypotheses. They serve as a means to determine if the identity of your product has a market without requiring significant time and financial investment. However, understanding how to create an effective MVP and utilize the Learning Process is not an easy task.

The Catalog of MVPs presented in this repository aims to provide real-life examples of how you can employ MVPs to validate your product.

<!-- Types of MVPs -->
<h2 align="left">Types of MVPs</h2>

| **MVP**  | **Description** | **Examples**
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Landing Page** | A Landing Page is a web page designed to showcase and explain your product. It is commonly used as a supplement to the actual product being developed, helping people understand its purpose and features. In certain cases, a Landing Page may be created even before the product exists, serving as a way to gauge interest and determine if there is demand for it. | <a href="#buffer">Buffer</a> |
| **Crowdfunding** | The product is showcased on a crowdfunding website, where the target market can contribute funds to support the project. This strategy is typically employed when there is a lack of sufficient funds to bring the product to fruition. In return for their support, individuals who contribute to the funding campaign receive exclusive benefits. These benefits may include opportunities to communicate with the developers, provide valuable feedback, share ideas, gain early access to a beta version of the product, or even receive the product for free, depending on the level of their financial contribution. | <a href="#oculus-rift">Oculus Rift</a> |
| **Video**  | A video showcasing your product, presenting its features, and effectively conveying that the value of your idea is an essential asset for the market. | <a href="#dropbox">Dropbox</a> |
| **Concierge**  | The entire product is executed manually by individuals without a functioning product. | <a href="#food-on-the-table">Food on the Table</a>, <a href="#airbnb">Airbnb</a> |
| **The Wizard of Oz** | Although the user can interact with the product, the backend is actually done by people without the user's awareness. | <a href="#zappos">Zappos</a>, <a href="#easy-taxi">Easy Taxi</a>, <a href="#amazon">Amazon</a> |
| **Piecemeal** | It works like The Wizard of Oz, however the backend uses tools to facilitate the manual process | <a href="#groupon">Groupon</a> |
| **Simple App** | The product has been intentionally designed with only the essential features required to effectively represent its core identity.  | <a href="#facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="#tinder">Tinder</a>, <a href="#instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="#twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="#spotify">Spotify</a> |

<!-- Zappos -->
<h2 align="left">Zappos</h2>
Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retail store for shoes would significantly simplify the process of purchasing desired footwear, eliminating the need for individuals to visit multiple physical stores.

**Description**: A website that specializes in reselling shoes sourced from various shoe stores. However, a significant portion of the backend operations is carried out manually. The founder, Nick Swinmurn, personally visits shoe stores in advance, capturing pictures and verifying prices of the shoes. These details are then added to the website's listings. When a customer places an order, Swinmurn revisits the respective stores, purchases the shoes, and subsequently ships them to the customer's address.

**Features**: The website provided customers with the ability to view shoe pictures, prices, and additional details such as size and brand, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions. Furthermore, there was a streamlined delivery system in place where customers could provide their address, and Zappos would handle shipping the shoes directly to them. While the scale of these features was relatively small, it presented a significant challenge for Nick Swinmurn to ensure that the process appeared automated and seamless. Due to his manual efforts, Nick focused on incorporating only essential features that were necessary to test his hypothesis, avoiding any unnecessary work.

<!-- Dropbox -->
<h2 align="left">Dropbox</h2>
File hosting service

#### Type: Video
**Date**: 2008.

Link to the original mvp video, uploaded by theragax: https://youtu.be/7QmCUDHpNzE 

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily share documents and pictures with other people, using a file hosting service.

**Description**: A video that shows how the share system of their file hosting service works, created to see if people would have interest on the idea.

The founder, Drew Houston, used a very casual and friendly wording on his video, to make it appeal to more people, using some hidden jokes through the video. This method made Drew look likable and relatable. The MVP showed how to use the feature, almost like a tutorial, which was also an opportunity to show why a file hosting service could be useful to people. It works fast and simple on the video, making it sell the idea of a well made product. Houston was able to validate the hypothesis with the number of new users that registered to their beta version, that went from 5,000 to 75,000 in one day.

**Features**: The prototype had the ability to place your folders on the Dropbox folder to upload the content to the cloud storage system. You could see all the files that were in sync with Dropbox by checking their website. Although functional, the prototype was not ready for the public, so presenting the early stage development version of the product through a video could suggest the idea of a fast and optimized product, the exact characteristics that Drew Houston believed would make his product stand out compared to the competition.

<!-- Facebook -->
<h2 align="left">Facebook</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: Students would like to share their university experiences through a social website that connects people.

**Description**: The initial concept was a social media website specifically designed for Harvard students to connect with others they had encountered on campus, fostering discussions and sharing experiences related to the university. In 2003, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, created a website called Face Share, which allowed people to vote on the most beautiful students at Harvard. However, it was primarily intended as a joke and was eventually taken down by the university. Nevertheless, this experience served as inspiration for Zuckerberg to explore the idea of utilizing the internet to facilitate student engagement, leading to the development of his first true minimum viable product (MVP) called The Facebook.

As time progressed, Facebook expanded its focus to become a social media platform for individuals beyond just Harvard students. It gradually introduced additional features and adapted them to cater to a broader audience.

**Features**: Facebook allowed students to create accounts with profile pictures and descriptions about themselves. Users could add and remove friends, as well as engage with groups to have discussions about their university experiences. It created a sense of community for the students and felt like a social extension of their time on campus.

![facebook_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234598165-ac972af8-8bd6-4eb7-a9ba-d9d50145f521.png)

<!-- Tinder -->
<h2 align="left">Tinder</h2>

Online dating app.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to easily arrange a date and set up a meeting.

**Description**: The app in question is a dating-focused platform where users create profiles to connect with potential matches. If two profiles express mutual interest, they achieve a match, granting them the ability to communicate and potentially arrange an in-person date. Originally named MatchBox, the app eventually evolved into what we now know as Tinder. Its core features remained largely unchanged over time due to its initial success and the effectiveness of its focused and simplistic approach. From its early days, the app demonstrated great appeal among university students. Initially, users could express their interest by liking or disliking other profiles. However, within just one year of its first minimum viable product (MVP), the developers introduced a unique and iconic feature: the swipe. Replacing the like and dislike buttons, the swipe feature allowed users to swipe right to express interest (like) or swipe left to indicate disinterest (dislike). This innovation not only accelerated the process of expressing interest in another person but also gave Tinder its distinctive identity. The swipe feature set Tinder apart from other dating apps at the time, contributing to its widespread popularity.

**Features**: Users of the app had the ability to create profiles, providing some information about themselves and adding photographs. The app featured a like and dislike function, enabling users to express their preference by giving a thumbs up or thumbs down to other profiles. If two profiles mutually liked each other, a match would be established. This would trigger a notification for both users, indicating their mutual interest and granting them the opportunity to initiate a chat, allowing them to get to know each other better. It's important to note that the fundamental aspects of searching for other users and the matching feature still define the app's identity today.
During its early stages, the app had a limited reach, and therefore did not incorporate a proximity feature to display the geographical distance between profiles. However, as the app began to expand across the country and eventually worldwide, the addition of a proximity feature became necessary for users to connect with others in their vicinity.

<!-- Easy Taxi -->
<h2 align="left">Easy Taxi</h2>

Mobile App for taxi hailing.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 2011.

**Hypothesis**: People would like a service that arranges a taxi for them.

**Description**: A web page that served as a platform for individuals to request a cab, with the backend being handled manually. Customers would place their taxi orders through the Easy Taxi website by providing their address and name. This generated an email notification sent to the founders, containing the customer's provided information. The founders would then use this information to contact a cab company and arrange the pick-up.This approach eliminated the need for the development of a complex system that tracks the user's location or automatically assigns a taxi driver based on the customer's address. By utilizing this manual process, the founders were able to validate their hypothesis in a simpler and cost-effective manner, without the requirement for a sophisticated infrastructure.

**Features**: The website had a single feature, which allowed users to call a taxi to their location by providing some basic information such as their name, email, location, destination, and even the color of their outfit. Once the details were submitted, users simply had to wait for the cab to arrive. While the website provided a level of convenience to customers, it did require some effort as users had to enter their personal information each time they requested a cab. Additionally, the user interface was primarily designed for desktop usage, which limited the overall user experience. Although the convenience provided by the website was not at the level the founders of Easy Taxi aspired to deliver to their customers, it was sufficient for testing their hypothesis. The focus at that stage was to determine if their concept would resonate with users and meet their needs.

![easy-taxi_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/233426377-72b3c2e7-f625-4706-a838-601eac4f1d83.png)

<!-- Instagram -->
<h2 align="left">Instagram</h2>

A social network focused on sharing photos and videos.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in sharing their meetings at public places.

**Description**: Initially known as Burbn, the app aimed to enable users to share their experiences at public places while incorporating gamification elements such as scoring points for posting a meeting. However, Burbn did not achieve significant success. Following a careful analysis of user feedback, the founders identified that the photo-sharing feature was particularly well-received by users. This realization led to a strategic shift known as the Zoom-In pivot, resulting in a rebranding of the app as Instagram and a narrowed focus on the photo-sharing functionality. Recognizing the strong appeal of photo sharing, the founders sought to make the process of sharing pictures easy and accessible to all users. They introduced straightforward filters that did not require any specialized knowledge of photo editing. By simplifying the photo-sharing experience and emphasizing user-friendly features, the founders believed that Instagram could thrive as a standalone social media platform centered around visual content.

**Features**: Users had the ability to create profiles on Instagram, providing personal descriptions and profile photos to represent themselves to their added friends. The platform featured a feed that displayed photographs posted by their friends. These pictures could undergo simple alterations such as resizing, adjusting saturation and colors, and applying various filters that could significantly change the tone and ambiance of the image. This allowed users to easily modify their photographs without the need for a complex photo editor like Photoshop, making it accessible to individuals without professional editing skills.The ability to like your friend's photo and make comments made users engage with each other by sharing their thoughts.

<!-- Food on the Table -->
<h2 align="left">Food on the Table</h2>

An app that helps you plan meals based on your own preferences and on the ingredients's prices near your home.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: People are interested in having an app that provides them with recipes for meals they are interested in, while also displaying nearby grocery stores that offer the best prices for the required ingredients.

**Description**: The MVP of the app was developed as a manual process, without the need for programming or external tools. The founders personally interacted with users, gathered their preferences, visited supermarkets and grocery stores to check ingredient prices, and delivered the items to their clients. The initial phase began with a single client and gradually expanded with more customers. Through this hands-on approach, the founders gained valuable insights into the project's intricacies, learning about the practicalities involved and avoiding unnecessary time and financial investment in developing a complex app without a clear market demand or future prospects.

**Features**: The process involved customers sharing their preferences, enabling the founders to create customized recipes and identify the locations with the best ingredient prices. The founders would then physically visit the grocery stores and supermarkets to gather the necessary ingredients. These ingredients, along with detailed cooking instructions, would be delivered directly to the customer's residence. This approach made the concept highly appealing to individuals interested in cooking, as it eliminated the need for customers to personally visit stores and allowed them to simply await the delivery. In this MVP, there was no specific feature that needed to be implemented in an application. Rather, it was an abstraction of the real product.

![food-on-the-table_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/234931770-66526bc5-b28d-4463-a086-54259a891b96.png)

<!-- Amazon -->
<h2 align="left">Amazon</h2>
Most known for being an online retailer of many types of products, although Amazon also offers services such as cloud computing and digital streaming.

#### Type: The Wizard of Oz
**Date**: 1995.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in buying multiple products online, without the need to visit stores.

Jeff Bezos, the founder, started testing this hypothesis by scaling it down to books only.

**Description**: An online retailer store that sells books, however part of the backend was done manually. Jeff Bezos believed that online retailer stores were the future of the industry and the internet, so he started selling books online, because there were many books, and they were easy to buy and ship, they did not require big investments and they were an extremely popular product. The first Amazon website is an extremely simple website, since all it did was sell books online, although Jeff Bezos would also physically buy the books and mail them to the customers.

Bezos would add more types of products over the time, slowly validating his main hypothesis.

**Features**: The website allowed people to choose which books to buy, so they could order them to be delivered at their home. The search system for products was not complex, because it had to work for books only, so this feature would gradually become more robust as more products were added. Originally, the front page talked about how Amazon was the perfect place to buy books, giving simple explanations to what the website was and what it could offer, a needed introduction given that, at the time, online retailer stores were basically non-existent, so customers had to first learn what Amazon actually was. Over time, the entire layout of the website would change to accommodate the new products and make it clear that Amazon was way more than just about selling books.

![amazon_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/235662931-99e8336f-4b37-4a70-be7b-d0706a49fdd3.png)

<!-- Groupon -->
<h2 align="left">Groupon</h2>

An e-commerce marketplace where you can hire and visit local services.

#### Type: Piecemeal
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to find places to visit and services to hire with ease and with a cheaper price.

**Description**: A website where people receive coupons on their emails, however the backend was done manually with the help of external tools. Groupon was first called The Point, and it was a website where people would use social media for a cause or common goal. Andrew Mason, the founder, realized that people were using The First to make groups of people buy a product with the goal of gaining a discount. A Customer Need pivot happened, where Andrew decided to solve a problem from his customers that he did not think about, which was the ability to get discounts for products and services. Groupon was created and it was very simple. All it did, at first, was to send emails to the people that worked on the same building as Andrew, with a coupon discount to the pizza restaurant that was also present on the same building. It later on escalated to a website where part of the backend used a script that would automatically send the coupons to the buyer.

**Features**: The Point had lots of features, like being able to make an account, find campaigns that you could join and be part of or create your own campaign, while also joining communities to discuss said campaigns. The Piecemeal MVP for Groupon, on the other hand, was very simple, and all it did was send emails to the people Andrew worked with, and nothing more than that. The more advanced version of Groupon would be a Simple App MVP with features like being able to search for coupons and find out which coupons were available so you could use them for discounts. The website would abstract the idea of a coupon, so what it does is show products and services with a discount, and that discount represents the coupon you would physically use in a store.

<!-- Twitter -->
<h2 align="left">Twitter</h2>

Online social networking service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People want to easily get in touch with friends through fast messages that are shared to all the user's followers.

**Description**: A social media website that allows users to follow people and write short messages that can be seen by their followers. The feed of this website had a list of messages from people you follow. The idea started as just a fast way for employees to communicate with each other, and after seeing the success of this idea amongst the company, Jack Dorsey, the founder, decided to make a proper social media, that was originally called twttr. The idea was original and not seen anywhere else on the internet, so it was hard to define, at the time, what twttr actually was. As time passed, it became clear Twitter would also be about spreading information between groups of people that are interested in the same topic, moving away from just being about updating your friends about your daily lives.

**Features**: The website allowed people to make an account and briefly customize their profile. Users would add followers, and the name "follower" was used because this social media was about people sharing common interests with anyone, and not just friends. The users were also able to write a very small text, with the goal of incentivizing users to share small thoughts they have along the day, and this text would appear on the feed of your followers. Many would use the website to just update on their daily lives and share these moments with friends, but in between the routine updates, there were comments about topics that were interesting to people, like movies, games and books. People with common interests would start to follow each other, removing the sense that you are communicating with just friends. 

The website was very unique, which made people passionate enough to come up with clever ways to circumvent the lack of some basic features, like the reply feature that was missing, that made users say who they were talking to as if it was a mail letter, and sometimes users would even copy and paste the comment they were replying to. The unique identity of Twitter made the developers opt to a front page that had to explain what the website was, while also using a language that was common on the internet, like the word "really" that was instead written as "rly", or "in my opinion" as "imo", to emphasize the idea that this social media is about short and concise messages with a more casual tone to it.

![twitter_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/235714298-65d2c34c-6316-4ecd-bce9-a3886da7671d.png)

<!-- Buffer -->
<h2 align="left">Buffer</h2>
A software that allows you to manage your social media accounts, like being able to schedule your posts and check their statistics (engagement with the community) 

#### Type: Landing Page
**Date**: 2010.

**Hypothesis**: Some people would like to manage their multiple social medias through a single application

**Description**: A 2 page website where the first page showed what Buffer was capable of doing, while the second one allowed the person to give their email for future information about the product. However, the app did not even exist, and the only purpose of making a Landing Page was to see if people had interest in the app, allowing Joel Gascoigne, the founder of Buffer, to gather evidence about his idea being good (or not). The Landing Page was small, simple, and explained extremely well what the product was capable of doing, which means it did not require people to invest much time on the website.

![buffer_mvp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42478443/236283241-35a975a0-766e-434d-b20a-3b705d5b8064.png)

<!-- Oculus Rift -->
<h2 align="left">Oculus Rift</h2>
A virtual reality gaming device.

#### Type: Crowdfunding
**Date**: 2012.

**Hypothesis**: Gamers have interest in buying a Virtual Reality headset. 

**Description**: An announcement for crowdfunding a Virtual Reality (VR) headset at the Kickstarter website. The first prototype was made in 2011 by Palmer Luckey, then it was presented at one of the biggest gaming events at the time called E3, in 2012. The product became famous and received positive feedback at the event, so Palmer decided to crowdfund it, given that he had no resources and money to accomplish his goals. VRs were a new technology at the time and were not accessible by most people, so a lot of gamers had interest in seeing this product have success.

<!-- Spotify -->
<h2 align="left">Spotify</h2>
A music streaming service.

#### Type: Simple App
**Date**: 2006.

**Hypothesis**: People have interest in listening to their music on a single app that does not require you to download the songs and allows you to avoid the risk of dealing with viruses and wrong downloads.

**Description**: A desktop app that had one feature: music streaming. Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, the founders of Spotify, already knew music streaming was a validated hypothesis. However, they wanted to do it with a higher quality when compared to the market. They wanted their application to be faster, so they focused a lot on decreasing the latency of their system, to make it feel as smooth as possible. As time moved on, they added more features to the MVP to refine it to the quality they visioned.

![spotify_mvp](https://github.com/memorieslp/awesome-mvps/assets/42478443/b588041f-eb00-4735-a65f-329b723e7879)

<!-- Airbnb -->
<h2 align="left">Airbnb</h2>
An online marketplace for homestay experiences, where you stay in a house or apartment from another person, and not from a hotel company.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2007.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to provide their residences as a place for other people to stay.

**Description**: Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, the founders of Aribnb, arranged a room from their apartment to look like a proper space for people to sleep at, similar to a hotel. They realized the city they lived in, San Francisco, had lots of conferences, but hotels were often full and were expensive. They decided to fix that problem by making a website where people could sleep in other people's residences. However, that idea was expensive. The founders used a conference to test this idea, using their own apartment to simulate the experiment. 

After realizing that people had interest in it, they created a very simple website, but it was focused on people that wanted to attend tech conferences. After some testing and success, the founders started to test if people were willing to have strangers spend time at their residences, and they did that with the same focus on tech conferences. Only later, after a lot of tests and changes to their website, did the founders start to expand their customers and remove this link between their website and tech conferences.
