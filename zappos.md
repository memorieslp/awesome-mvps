Online shoe and clothing retailer store

#### Type of MVP: The Wizard of Oz
MVP created in 1999.

**Hypothesis**: An online retailer store for shoes would make it much easier for people to buy the shoes they want to, without the need to go to multiple stores to find the shoes they want to.

**Description**: A website that resells shoes from multiple shoe stores, however most of the backend is done manually, like the pictures of the shoes that were taken by Nick Swinmurn, the founder, by visiting shoe stores. Swinmurn would also go to the real stores, buy the shoes, and send them to the costumer that bought the shoes on his online website.
