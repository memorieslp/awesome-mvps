<h2 align="left">Food on the Table</h2>

An app that helps you plan meals based on your own preferences and on the ingredients's prices near your home.

#### Type: Concierge
**Date**: 2004.

**Hypothesis**: People would like to have an app that shows them recipes for meals that they have interest in, while also showing nearby groceries that have the best prices for the ingredients they need.

**Description**: The MVP was a manual process, with no programing required or any use of external tools. The founders would talk to people, find out their preferences, go to the supermakets and grocery stores to check the prices of the ingredients, and deliver them to their clients. It started with one client, and slowly scalated to more and more people. The founders were able to learn the nuances of this project, by talking to people and learning how the process works in practice, while also not spending any time or money on programing a very ambitious and complex app that they did not know if it had a future and a place on the market.
