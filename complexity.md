| **MVP**  | **Effort** | **When to use it**
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Landing Page** | ⭐ | The need to come up with a clever way to represent the identity of your product on a well organized web page is the hardest aspect of a Landing Page MVP. A quick way of showing your hypothesis may help a lot to validate it, even though the customers did not have any contact with a real product. The act of promising a demanding product can be enough to make people interested in it.  |
| **Crowdfunding** | ⭐⭐ | This MVP not only needs to show well the identity of the product, but it also needs to show enough evidence that the product is possible to be made, given that people will fund your project and will demand it to exist. There is also the need to come up with a clever business plan that offers good advantages to the funders, and that shows a roadmap with goals to be achieved. When funding is hard to get, a Crowdfunding may be one of the only options to release your product. |
| **Video**  | ⭐⭐ | A video can fake features, pretending that they exist, allowing video editing to represent the product in its optimal state. However, it can also be used to showcase features that are not ready for release, so regardless of the real state of your project, the video needs to appeal to the audience and represent well what your MVP is about. Just like a Landing Page, a Video MVP is another way to attract customers to your product.  |
| **Concierge**  | ⭐⭐⭐ | The product needs to simulate the real product, but how the simulation happens is the real challenge of this MVP. This type of MVP suits more ideas that are not common, with hypotheses that are not validated yet. It can also be used as a way to gather information about how the real product should work, by getting in touch with the customers and understanding what is needed to be present for the project to work.  |
| **The Wizard of Oz** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Some products' biggest challenges are the implementations of robust and expensive backend operations. Even though most of the product can be made and be well represented, the backend can be too much effort for the developers. Making the backend be manual without the customers noticing it, is a hard but needed challenge that can alleviate the complexity of a real system. |
| **Piecemeal** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Piecemeal faces the same philosophy as The Wizard of Oz, and being able to use external tools to help the backend process can make the system way easier to implement. |
| **Simple App** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | Some systems are based on complex hypotheses that demand a more sophisticated product right at the beginning of the project. A Simple App needs to focus only at the features that really validate the identity of the product, more than any other MVP, because almost the entire product is already functional. |
